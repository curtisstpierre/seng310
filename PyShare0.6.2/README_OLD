This scripts allows you to easily upload images, screenshots, or other files and gives you links for: IM, Forums, HTML, Direct, Forums Thumbnail, HTML Thumbnail and Twitter(rapidshare gives only IM Forums and HTML)

Before use: 
1. unpack or link folder to ~/.gnome2/nautilus-scripts
2. install python-pycurl (if not already installed)
3. install scrot (only if you want to send screenshots, not needed for sending files)
For best lossless compression install also optipng nad set 'filesize' to 0 in sendScreenshot.py(not advised on slow computer with fast connection, strongly advised on strong computer with slow connection)

If above don't work you may need to restart nautilius
